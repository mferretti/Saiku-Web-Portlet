This is an attempt to integrate saiku web UI into a liferay portlet.

You should at least have apache-ant, liferay 6.0.6 plugins and an instance of liferay 6.0.6 on your machine .
Make sure you checkout this git into <liferay-plugins>/portlets.
If you have all the above, creating and deploying the application is a matter of issuing the commad "ant" .

An eclipse project is also ready : you just need to import it using the "Import existing project" in eclipse. 


Saiku is an open source analysis suite and can be found at http://analytical-labs.com/
Liferay is an open source portal and can be found at http://www.liferay.com/
